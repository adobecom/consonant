# Documentation Index

Use this index to find the right reference quickly. Each subdirectory focuses on a distinct slice of the system.

- `component-audit/` – Current state of component coverage (accordion, cards, layout containers, etc.)
- `future-notes/` – Forward-looking plans and decisions (e.g., Consonant 1 deprecation, upcoming Figma plugins)
- `guardrails/` – Authoring + implementation guardrails, including Story UI considerations and the "no primitives in components" rules
- `how-tos/` – Task-focused guides and runbooks (`runbook-token-pipeline.md`, `token-pipeline-steps-figjam.md`)
- `setup-guides/` – Environment/config setup for MCP, Story UI, etc.
- `workflows/` – End-to-end process diagrams like `figma-to-code-workflow.md`

For Story UI prompts or guardrailed builds, load the files under `docs/guardrails/`. For operational work (tokens, pipelines, releases), start in `docs/how-tos/`.
