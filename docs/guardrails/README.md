# Design-System Guardrails

This directory houses every rule we expect Codex/Claude/Cursor (and humans!) to follow when authoring code for the design system. Each guardrail lives in its own file so we can bookmark and evolve them independently.

## Guardrail Index

- [No primitives inside components](./no-primitives-in-components.md)
- [Figma component authoring](./figma-component-authoring.md)

Add new guardrails here when we discover a policy worth enforcing.
