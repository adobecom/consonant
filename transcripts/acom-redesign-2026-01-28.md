Meeting notes:
CAS (Card as a Service) System Overview and Design Implications:
Adam, Sanjay, Josh, Elliot, Paul, and Ryan discussed the CAS (Card as a Service) system, its architecture, design flexibility, and the challenges of maintaining consistency and scalability across Adobe web properties, with input from multiple team members on design and engineering alignment.
CAS System Functionality: Sanjay explained that CAS is a system for displaying collections of cards on Adobe web pages, allowing users to search, filter, and interact with large libraries of content, sometimes reaching up to 10,000 cards. The cards are dynamically populated and can be personalized for different users.
Design Variability and Grid System: Elliot and Josh raised questions about the flexibility of grid and gutter systems within CAS, noting legacy design decisions that allowed for variable spacing and layouts. Josh emphasized the need to standardize grid options and reduce unnecessary complexity, suggesting that the platform UX team could help align design and engineering efforts.
Styling and Encapsulation: Paul, Josh, and CR BASL 04/GRUNER VC (5) clarified that CAS delivers both content and encapsulated styles, functioning similarly to an iframe, which ensures consistent appearance across different pages and sites, but also creates challenges for global design updates and parity with other components.
Global Design Alignment: Elliot and Josh discussed the risks of design divergence between CAS and other page elements, advocating for tighter integration so that global changes (e.g., typography, spacing) propagate consistently. Josh highlighted the opportunity to align CAS with the broader design system, reducing the need for duplicate updates.
CAS Usage Scope: Matthew noted that CAS is not universally used across all Adobe web properties, with many card-like objects and triptychs implemented outside of CAS, meaning that changes to CAS do not currently affect the entire site.
Authoring Platform Principles and Constraints:
CR BASL 04/GRUNER VC (5), Vivian, Ryan, and Josh detailed the principles, constraints, and workflows of the authoring platform, emphasizing its author-first philosophy, reliance on Word/DA documents, and the importance of consistency, scalability, performance, accessibility, and global readiness.
Author-First Platform Philosophy: CR BASL 04/GRUNER VC (5) described the platform's guiding principle that content authors, not engineers, are the primary builders of pages. Authoring is text-driven, readable, and requires minimal technical skills, with content structured in Word or DA documents before any code is written.
Content Consistency and Structure: The team emphasized the need for consistent, machine-readable content that avoids duplication and supports both mobile and desktop experiences. Structured content enables scalability and easier extension for future needs.
Scalability and Performance: Scalability is achieved through reusable blocks, tokens, and platform patterns, while performance is prioritized to achieve high Core Web Vitals scores, which are critical for search rankings and user experience.
Accessibility and Globalization: Accessibility is a non-negotiable requirement, mandated from the outset of design and development. The platform also ensures that designs accommodate different content lengths and languages, supporting a global audience.
Authoring Limitations: Vivian and Ryan highlighted limitations such as lack of support for font size changes and text alignment in the authoring tools, with only certain formatting options available. Variants are used to control some aspects, but the system intentionally restricts granular styling to maintain consistency.
Balancing Flexibility and Simplicity in Authoring and Design:
Elliot, Josh, Ryan, and Rikio debated the trade-offs between providing flexibility for designers and maintaining simplicity for content authors, discussing the use of templates, variants, and the need to avoid system bloat while supporting both standard and bespoke design moments.
Template and Variant Usage: The group discussed how templates and variants can be used to provide authors with predefined layouts and options, reducing the need for manual configuration while still allowing for some customization where necessary.
Limiting Authoring Complexity: Josh and Ryan stressed the importance of limiting the number of options available to authors to prevent confusion and maintain system scalability. They advocated for strong defaults and selective exposure of advanced features.
Sandbox Moments for Customization: Josh proposed the concept of 'sandbox moments'—special cases where designers and engineers can collaborate to create highly customized, visually impactful pages, while the majority of content follows standardized templates.
Design-Engineering Collaboration: Elliot and Rikio agreed on the need for clear communication and alignment between design and engineering teams to define priorities, trade-offs, and the right balance between flexibility and restriction in the authoring process.
Authoring Workflow Demonstration and Technical Details:
Ryan provided a detailed demonstration of the authoring workflow in DA and SharePoint, showing how blocks, variants, and responsive design are implemented, and answered technical questions from Elliot and others about video handling, accessibility, and preview capabilities.
Block and Variant Authoring: Ryan demonstrated how authors use the Sidekick tool to insert complex blocks like hero marquees, configure variants for different layouts and features, and manage content for different breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop) using tables and flags.
Responsive and Media Handling: The demonstration included examples of how images and videos are assigned to different breakpoints, how background videos and overlays are managed, and how authors can preview changes in real time within DA.
Accessibility and Metadata: Elliot and Josh discussed the process for ensuring accessibility metadata (e.g., alt text) is provided at the content ingestion point, with Ryan clarifying that while the technology supports it, the process relies on upstream content providers to supply the necessary information.
Limitations and Future Improvements: The team acknowledged current limitations, such as the lack of WYSIWYG controls and the complexity of managing variants via tables, and discussed the potential for evolving the authoring pattern to include more intuitive controls or templates in the future.
Platform Evaluation and Future Direction:
Justin, Ryan, CR BASL 04/GRUNER VC (5), and Rikio discussed the rationale for using the current Adobe CMS (AEM/EDS), its performance advantages, and the need to define priorities for future improvements, while considering comparisons with other CMS solutions.
Platform Selection Rationale: Ryan and CR BASL 04/GRUNER VC (5) explained that the current CMS platform was chosen for its ability to deliver high performance (near-perfect Lighthouse scores) and scalability, which were lacking in previous systems like Dexter.
Comparison with Other CMS: Justin asked about comparisons with other CMS platforms like Sanity, and the team clarified that Adobe is both the developer and primary customer of the platform, which is also sold to external clients.
Defining Priorities for Improvement: Rikio emphasized the importance of defining the desired balance between flexibility and restriction in authoring, so that future platform improvements can be targeted to meet the team's needs.
Follow-up tasks:
CAS and Global Design System Alignment:
Evaluate and propose a process to ensure CAS styling is tightly aligned with global design system tokens and updates, minimizing the need for parallel changes in multiple places. (Josh, Elliot, Platform UX Team)
Authoring Platform Flexibility and Restrictions:
Define and document the optimal balance between flexibility and restriction in authoring tools, specifying which design controls (e.g., padding, type, alignment) should be available or limited for non-design authors. (Elliot, Rikio, Engineering Team)
Accessibility Metadata in Content Pipeline:
Review and improve the process to ensure accessibility metadata (e.g., alt text, meta tags) is consistently delivered from Dentsu and preserved through the content ingestion pipeline. (Josh, Ryan, Dentsu)
Design-to-Authoring Handoff Alignment:
Collaborate to establish clear rules and processes for handling text alignment and variance, especially for internationalization (RTL/LTR), to prevent issues during design-to-authoring handoff. (Kyung, Engineering Team)
Overlay Feature for Design QA:
Assess feasibility and, if possible, implement a feature in DA to allow overlaying design comps (e.g., PNG/JPEG) during preview for more efficient QA and reduced ticket churn. (Ryan, CR BASL 04/GRUNER VC (5))
